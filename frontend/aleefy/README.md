Documentation for form handling and validation


Form handling and validation are done using simple ReactJs usage. On the client side, a useState is used to keep an eye on the changing variables inside our contact form field. The function setFormData is the one used to keep the formData available for further usage. Validation is also done on the html side where it checks whether the user entered valid values such as a valid email address and a name. Displays proper error messages if not.
